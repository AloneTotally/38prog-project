# 38PROG C CLI Project
This is a CLI program made in C that was made to track someones calorie intake.
I developed this project for my Programming module (38PROG) as part of my Diploma in Engineering Science.

Due to requirements stating that everything is in one file, I just have one C file that is 1200 lines long, and when the program is run the necessary .csv files will be created.

## Flow of the program
